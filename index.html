	<h3>CONFERENCE OVERVIEW</h3>
			<div class="newspaper">
			<p>Digital marketplace has transformed every aspect of our lives. Data are the life blood of this marketplace and how that data are created, captured, and curated, is deciding the difference between today and tomorrow's winners and wannabes. Further to that, while digital marketplace is called to be the great equalizer by many, its benefits are often not enjoyed equally across the world; indeed, this chasm between the haves and the have nots is increasing. Internet is a necessity in today's rapidly globalising world. While the global market penetration has been unprecedented in emerging economies, the digital divide continues to be a challenge in many lower-middle and low-income societies. Other major challenges pertain to - the use of data analytics in solving business problems; the role of social media
platforms; what triggers customer engagement and how do we drive that; at what point do we engage with customers, through which channel and with what message; how do businesses navigate the
organizational, government institutional and infrastructure challenges, and what the future of data, analytics and narratives will look like across a spectrum of business sectors and societies. </p>
<p>

Butchallenges present opportunities for growth and innovation. From  electronic commerce, to mobile commerce to social commerce, we are engaging in digital marketplace with greater enthusiasm on a global scale. And the glue that binds us in this marketplace are the multitudes of narratives. From our personal narratives that appear on social media websites to organizational narratives that appear on corporate websites and then there are global narratives that combine news, politics, organizations and people. Digital narratives have made us more connected, as seen through movements such as black lives matter', and at the same time has created ongoing debates and political and ideological divergences. </p>
<p>

In this marketplace, which commends itself for the abundance of data, answers will only emerge if we ask the right questions, deploy optimal analytics, and then tell the story with appropriate narratives with well- configured mediums. This conference aims to create a scholarly platform wherein such narratives will converge, diverge and collide. Through these debates will emerge the new narratives that are more holistic, more powerful, and more equitable. We welcome you to join us on this fascinating journey of creating, curating and complementing new knowledge on the frontiers of data and analytics!</p>
